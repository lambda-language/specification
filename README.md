# Lambda language
Lambda is a language inspired by some mathematics notations and mostly influenced by the functional programming paradigm with a focus on extending typed lambda calculus.

The language supports many levels of programming as type level and value level. It is designed to be a functional lambda calculus language with a strong type system while keeping a pleasant and logical syntax.
